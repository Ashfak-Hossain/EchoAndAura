## ADR-001 — Manual bKash verification instead of API integration

**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The client does not have a bKash merchant account and cannot obtain
one before the launch date.

**Decision:** Buyers pay manually and submit a transaction ID. An admin verifies
against the bKash statement and approves, which triggers automatic ticket issue.

**Consequences:** No payment API, tokens, callbacks, or reconciliation job.
Introduces manual admin workload (~1 hour/day at 1,000 attendees) and requires a
24-hour inventory hold rather than a 10-minute cart hold. Transaction ID
uniqueness must be enforced at the database level to prevent reuse.

**Revisit when:** a merchant account is obtained — the state machine is designed
so an API path can be added without changing the fulfilment logic.

## ADR-002 — 24-hour inventory hold

**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Manual verification may take hours. A 10-minute cart hold would
expire before an admin ever sees the order.

**Decision:** Inventory is held for 24 hours on order submission, released on
rejection or expiry. Orders are capped at 10 tickets to limit the damage a
malicious or abandoned order can do to availability.

**Consequences:** A sold-out event may show unavailable while holds are pending.
Accepted because the alternative — overselling — is worse.

## ADR-003 — Adopt latest major versions at scaffold time

**Date:** 2026-09-15 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Phase 0 was scaffolded with the latest available majors rather than
the versions the original `CLAUDE.md § Stack` list assumed. `create-next-app@latest`
and the subsequent installs resolved to newer majors.

**Decision:** Build on the latest _stable_ majors: Next.js 16 (was 15), React 19,
Node 26 (runtime; `.nvmrc`), Tailwind 4, drizzle-orm 0.45 with the **postgres-js**
driver (`postgres`, not `pg`), Vitest 5, Playwright 1.x. Drizzle 1.0 exists only
as a pre-release (rc/beta) and was **not** adopted — the data layer stays on the
stable 0.45 line.

**Consequences / breaking-change handling:**

- `next lint` was removed in Next 16 → the `lint` script calls `eslint` directly.
- Next 16 generates route-aware type helpers (`LayoutProps`/`PageProps`), so
  `typecheck` runs `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` (else a fresh checkout/CI fails
  before `tsc` starts).
- Next 16 auto-manages an agent-rules block via `next dev`; an `AGENTS.md` at the
  repo root hosts it so `CLAUDE.md` is never rewritten.
- vitest 5 pulls vite 8, which declared a dependency on an unpublished
  `lightningcss@^1.33.0`; pinned to `1.32.0` via a pnpm override in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- The bleeding-edge stack has React-19 peer mismatches, so
  `strict-peer-dependencies=false` in `.npmrc` (warnings still print).
- The Vitest config is `vitest.config.mts` (ESM) to satisfy vite's native loader.

**Revisit when:** Drizzle 1.0 reaches stable GA (evaluate upgrade); or when peer
warnings clear as the ecosystem catches up to React 19 — then re-enable
`strict-peer-dependencies`.

## ADR-004 — Auth instance lives outside `src/server/`

**Date:** 2026-09-15 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** better-auth's `nextCookies()` plugin — required so server actions can
set the session cookie — transitively imports `next/headers`. `src/server/` must
stay free of `next/*` so the BullMQ worker can import business logic directly.

**Decision:** The auth instance is `src/lib/auth.ts`. A Next-free options builder,
`src/lib/auth-options.ts`, is shared with `scripts/create-admin.ts`. Business
logic in `src/server/` never imports auth; it receives the acting admin as a
parameter. There is exactly one admin: public sign-up is disabled and the account
is seeded once through the public `signUpEmail` API.

**Consequences:** Auth is an app-layer concern; services stay runtime-agnostic and
testable without a request scope. Auth tables are plural (`usePlural: true`) to
avoid the Postgres reserved word `user`. Guarding is two-layer: `src/proxy.ts`
(Next 16 proxy) does an optimistic cookie check; the `(protected)` layout does the
authoritative DB-backed session check.

**Revisit when:** more than one admin or role-based access is needed
(better-auth's `admin` plugin).

## ADR-005 — Service/repository shape: factories, a composition root, typed domain errors

**Date:** 2026-09-16 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The first real `src/server/` vertical (event CRUD) sets the
template every later service follows, including `fulfilment.service.ts`. A
service that imports a concrete repository transitively imports
`src/db/client.ts`, which requires `DATABASE_URL` at import time — so unit
tests would need a database just to load the module.

**Decision:**

- A repository module exports an **interface** plus one real implementation
  bound to `db`, and is the only code that touches Drizzle for its table. It
  maps database-enforced constraints to typed errors (e.g. Postgres `23505` on
  `events_slug_unique` → `EventSlugTakenError`) — uniqueness is never checked
  by read-then-write.
- A service is a **factory** (`createEventsService(repo)`) depending only on
  the repository interface. It throws typed domain errors from
  `src/server/lib/errors.ts` (`DomainError` subclasses).
- `src/server/container.ts` is the single **composition root** that wires
  services to real repositories; the app and the worker import instances from
  there.
- **Zod schemas live at the boundary** (`src/lib/validation/`), including
  cross-field rules; the service only ever receives coherent input. Server
  actions catch known domain errors by class and map them to messages;
  anything else is logged and surfaced generically (never disguised as a user
  mistake).
- All admin-facing wall-clock times are `Asia/Dhaka` (`src/lib/time.ts`);
  storage is UTC `timestamptz`.

**Consequences:** Service unit tests use in-memory fakes with no mocking
framework and no database. Adding a service means: repository interface +
impl, factory, one line in the container. Slightly more ceremony than
importing `db` directly — accepted for testability and the worker sharing the
same instances.

**Revisit when:** the number of services makes the container unwieldy
(consider a lightweight DI helper) — not expected within this project's scope.

## ADR-006 — Event status: transition table, readiness check, conditional UPDATE

**Date:** 2026-09-18 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Events move between `draft`, `published` and `archived`. A
half-configured event must never go live, an illegal move must be impossible
rather than merely unlikely, and two admin tabs acting at once must not leave
the status inconsistent.

**Decision:**

- The legal moves are a data table (`EVENT_TRANSITIONS` in
  `src/server/lib/event-status.ts`); `assertEventTransition` throws
  `InvalidEventTransitionError` for anything else. The admin UI renders its
  buttons from the same table, so it can never offer a move the service
  rejects. `archived → draft` is allowed so a mistaken archive is recoverable.
- Publishing is gated by a pure readiness function that returns _reasons_
  (`publishReadiness` → `PublishProblem[]`), not a boolean. The page shows the
  list as a checklist; the service refuses with `EventNotPublishableError`
  carrying the same messages. One source of truth for "why can't I publish".
  Checks today: ≥ 1 ticket type, start in the future, valid registration
  window. A cover image becomes a check when R2 upload lands.
- The status write is a conditional atomic UPDATE
  (`… WHERE id = $id AND status = $from RETURNING *`). Zero rows →
  `EventStatusConflictError`; no read-then-write window.

**Consequences:** `createEventsService` now depends on the ticket-types
repository (for the readiness count) and an injectable clock. Events have no
audit log — `updated_at` is the only trace of a status change. Orders keep
`order_events` (Invariant 6); if Raj ever asks "who unpublished this", add an
`event_events` table then, not now.

**Revisit when:** more statuses are needed (e.g. `cancelled` with buyer
notifications), or an event audit trail is requested.
